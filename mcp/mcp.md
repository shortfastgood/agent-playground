# The Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed to facilitate the interaction between AI agents and their environment. It provides a structured way for agents to communicate, share information, and collaborate on tasks. The MCP is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal.

The use of MCP servers may involve risks, article "[MCP Servers are not safe](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/mcp-servers-are-not-safe-bfbc2bb7aef8)" illustrates what they are and how to mitigate them.
