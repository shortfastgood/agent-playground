### Use Case Reverse Engineering of a Widget

To achieve a good result, simplicity is the best tool. If we are dealing with a complex representation, it is advisable to analyze and generate the code for each part separately. Subsequently, the codes can be recombined to recreate the complex surface.

Similarly, with the prompt, it is better not to insist on too many details. An essential request generally leads to a better initial structure. Details omitted can later be added with subsequent improvements through prompts.

The first step is to ask the model for an analysis of the image. The response provides the starting point for generating the code. It is important to use expressions and words from the model's response to formulate the request that generates the code.

See [research/use-case-widget-reverse-engineering/description.md](research/use-case-widget-reverse-engineering/description.md) for a detailed description of the use case.
