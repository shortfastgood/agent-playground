# Update Java Dependencies Agent Report

## Hardware and OS

Available hardware includes a MacBook Pro late 2019 (Intel i7) with 16 GB of memory, a Lenovo ThinkPad (AMD Ryzen PRO 7) with 32 GB of memory, and an HP PRO Mini 400 G9 (Intel i7) with 32 GB of memory.

HP PRO is not used directly but as a host for two virtual machines (Windows and Ubuntu) based on Hyper-V.

## Implementation

Access to the models is achieved through the API provided by the provider. For access to the Maven Central Repository, a direct request via HTTPS was chosen for simplicity.

## Tested Models and Providers

Three models and providers were tested: Azure AI / GPT-4o, Anthropic AI / claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, and Ollama / Llama3.2:3b. The first two are large LLMs provided by two specialized companies, while the third is an SLM that operates locally.

## Results

With the two large external models, a correct result is always obtained after a few seconds. With Ollama, it takes about 120 seconds and the result is not always correct; in one case, the local installation removed two dependencies even though this function was not requested.

A local installation also requires a real machine, as virtual systems respond too slowly to the sudden and massive memory requests from Ollama.
